                    We all know by now that society looks a bit different these days.  When the Coronavirus pandemic hit I was lucky enough to be in a safe place in Australia, with the resources to stay up to date on rent payments, feed myself, my partner and our dogs, stay in contact with my family in the States, and continue my studies online.  When it comes to online uni, I have mixed feelings about Zoom.  Sure, the program is useful and it has proven to be a great resource to connect people from all over the world during a difficult, contactless time.  However, the online sessions cannot replicate the in-person practical experience, especially when it comes to animal handling and clinical techniques.  That being said, online lectures have not been an issue for me as I prefer to watch lectures when I have the ability to pause and rewind to hear critical information.

                    Of course, I can recognise and appreciate the need to make a change to a virtual classroom, but I cannot help but feel disappointed, as I felt I had gotten off to a very productive start to DVM3, which pretty much came to a halt in March.  I am very much a practical, hands-on learner.  Being able to feel and experience real-life situations and try techniques out for myself is a huge part of my learning experience.  Without these opportunities, I have found myself low on motivation and productivity.  I feel like an athlete, only able to watch film and never even getting to go to training, let alone, play in a game.  I am trying hard not to get too down about the current state of our learning environment, and I commend all of our instructors and faculty for their help and adaptation to online teaching and I truly feel they are doing their best to provide us with the best learning experience available at this time.

                    I have been keeping myself busy and sane by picking up a number of projects to break up all the screen-time I have inevitably faced.  This has included:
                    <ul class="regul">
                        <li>
                            Building a rock climbing (bouldering) home-training wall with my partner in our garage
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Building a chicken coop to start our backyard flock
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Working on converting a Ford Transit van into our future home-on-wheels
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Training for my first half-marathon
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Spending quality time with my beloved dogs, Tali and Zeke
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am learning a lot about my motivations, strengths and weaknesses during this time, and I plan to use this knowledge to my advantage once “normal” operations resume.
