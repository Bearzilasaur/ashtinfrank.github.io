                    Since I was young, I have always been drawn to animals and the outdoors.  From hiding out in my backyard to catch a glimpse of a coyote scavenging in the desert of Arizona to kayaking alongside manatees through the canals on the west coast of Florida, I have always been fascinated by animals in nature, and passionate about their welfare and the overall wellbeing of the environment.

                    I grew up in both Phoenix, Arizona and Sarasota, Florida in the United States, two completely different climates which are home to a vast array of ecosystems and species to admire.  I attended Clemson University in South Carolina for two years before taking an opportunity to travel and study abroad at James Cook University in Townsville, Queensland Australia.  I quickly fell in love with the people, scenery and wildlife of Australia and transferred to JCU to complete my Bachelor of Science in Zoology and Ecology with the goal of subsequently studying a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.

                    Back in the States I had worked as an Animal Care Specialist and Kennel Technician at the Humane Society or Sarasota County before my big move to Far North Queensland.  I gained invaluable experience during my time at the Humane Society and deepened my compassion for animals of all species, particularly the underdogs (those without a home and owner to fight for them).  This passion translated to my becoming a macropod carer with North Queensland Wildlife Care, whilst I studied in Townsville.  My time as a carer really brought together all the aspects of zoology, ecology, environmental science, cultural emersion and animal medicine that excite me.

                    While my undergraduate degree provides a wonderful foundation, my true desire is to help individual animals in a practical, hands-on, and personal application.  I began my studies at The University of Melbourne in the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in 2018.  I am currently in my third year of the degree.

                    While I hope to have the opportunity to work with multiple species of different sizes, habitats and needs, I have developed a special interest in large animals, specifically cattle and sheep of small-scale production, with a focus on animal welfare and orthopaedics.  That being said, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for shelter medicine.
