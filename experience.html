                    I feel so lucky to have had many valuable experiences and opportunities on placements thus far in the DVM course.  The following are standout placements that have made significant impacts on my academic and personal progress in this degree.

                    <h3>Willow Creek Miniature Goats (Ellendale, Tasmania)</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was my first pre-clinical farm placement, and I could not have been more lucky.  Not only were the animals, scenery and daily work a pleasure to experience, but the hospitality of the farmers was beyond my expectations.  I have never felt so at home with a couple of strangers, and I was inspired in many ways.  Miniature goat farmers, Jan and Carl Roberts, are the epitome of wholesome.  I gained an invaluable experience developing a rapport with great farmers and learning a considerable amount about miniature goats and farming practices.

                    <h3>Alpaca Magic (Sutton, NSW)</h3>
                    <p>
                        It was great fun to experience the variety of animals Alpaca Magic has to offer.  I spent most of my time working with llamas who are eventually sold as livestock guardians or pets, which was a refreshing contrast to typical meat and dairy livestock operations we talk so much about.  Additionally, I had the opportunity to learn about training alpacas and donkeys, and had the pleasure of taking Miniature Galloway cattle to the local show.  This placement had great variation and I enjoyed immersing myself in the local country culture.

                    <h3>Collingwood Children's Farm (Abbotsford, Victoria)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Collingwood Children's Farm (CCF) is a place I wish I had grown up next to as a child.  It is a wonderful not-for-profit farm with a mission to educate the community about farming both animals and crops, promote sustainable and humane practices, and support those experiencing disadvantage.  The farmers and volunteers were a pleasure to work with, and it was evident they love what they do.  I had the unique experience of being on placement when Costa Georgiadis from Gardening Australia on ABC did a segment on CCF.  Another student and I had the privilege of teaching Costa about Anglo-Nubian goats and how to milk them.  It was overall a fun and rewarding placement experience with a variety of well-loved animals, friendly staff, and community members eager to learn.

                    <h3>Geelong Animal Welfare Society (Geelong, Victoria)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Geelong Animal Welfare Society (GAWS) shelter has such a wonderful, hard-working staff. I appreciate what they do daily and was delighted to learn how they do it.  I have always enjoyed being in a shelter atmosphere with like-minded people looking to make a difference in the lives of the rescue animals.  Although I attended GAWS as a pre-clinical placement, I had the fortunate opportunity to join some of the vets in the clinic as well.  After assisting with desexings and day-to-day shelter procedures, I can definitely picture myself working in a similar environment as a certified veterinarian in the near future.  I hope to return to GAWS for a clinical placement in DVM4.

                    <h3>Gungahlin Veterinary Hospital (Gungahlin, ACT)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gungahlin Veterinary Hospital (GVH) was my first proper clinical placement.  I feel I could not have chosen a better way to begin my clinical years.  I had the privilege of networking with and learning from some wonderful vets and vet nurses.  The staff was happy to teach me common clinical techniques, so I was able to get a head-start on DVM3 clinical years, as I attended this placement just before the new semester commenced.  Placement at GVH was a great introduction and segue into academic clinical years.  I feel that it gave me an important foundation on what to expect at a fast-paced, professional clinical practice, which nicely contrasted my experiences on farm and shelter placements.  Although my two weeks at GVH reiterated my desire to work largely outside with large animals and farmers, I feel it was such a valuable experience that introduced me to some very supportive and helpful future veterinary colleagues.
